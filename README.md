# PythonBlocks
PythonBlocks is ported from MIT's Open Blocks (http://education.mit.edu/openblocks), whose originial development language is JAVA. In order to make it more expandable, I rewrite all codes using python with PyQT, so that all your modules can be loaded dynamically and your codes can be run directly without re-compiling. I also fix several bugs and add many new enhancement compared with original JAVA version.

This is a block programming language tool, you can just drag-drop blocks to 'coding', then it will help you generate runable code as you expect.  It can be used in many areas, such as kids' programming learning, robot control, smart household controlling etc.
