# PythonBlocks
PythonBlocks was ported from MIT's Open Blocks (http://education.mit.edu/openblocks), it was origin developed by JAVA, in order to make it more expandable, I rewritted all codes using python with PyQT, with python, all your module can be load dynamically, your code can be run directly without re-compile whole system. I also fix several bugs and add many new enhancement compare with original JAVA version.

This is a block programming language tools, you can just drag-drop blocks to 'coding', then this tools will help you generate runable code as you expected.  it can be used in many areas, such as kids programming training, robot control, smart household controlling etc.
